Montréal Machine Learning and Optimization (MTL MLOpt) is a group of researchers living and working in Montréal.

Our research loosely spans topics in machine learning and mathematical optimization. Many of our members are affiliated with the Mila, where we also held our physical meetings (in pre-apocalyptic times). The group includes researchers from the University of Montréal, McGill, Google Brain, Samsung SAIT AI Lab (SAIL) Montreal, Facebook AI Research Montréal (FAIR) and Microsoft Research Montréal.

We hold public and internal meetings. The public meetings are a seminar with guest lecturers from around the world. Our public meetings are open for everyone to attend. Our internal meetings typically comprise of a presentation of a member's latest work, followed by discussion which often leads to productive collaborations.
